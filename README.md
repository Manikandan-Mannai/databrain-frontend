# 🧠 Data Query & Visualization Platform — Frontend Implementation

This is my implementation of the **Frontend** for the “Data Query & Visualization Platform” take-home assignment.  
I carefully went through the given brief, broke it down into deliverables, and focused on solving the real product and engineering challenges rather than just wiring screens.

---

## Understanding the Task

The frontend was expected to let users:

1. Connect or upload a **data source**  
2. Build **queries** that transform/aggregate data  
3. Create **visualizations** (charts/tables) from query results  
4. **Share dashboards** with different access levels (Admin, Editor, Viewer)

I structured the app to handle all these while ensuring smooth UX, performance, and scalability within the time constraint.

## My Approach & Design Choices

### 1. **Data Source Upload (CSV)**
Instead of overcomplicating with multiple sources, I focused on a clean **CSV upload flow** that instantly parses and stores dataset metadata in Redux for reusability across Query Builder and Chart Builder.  
I used Papaparse for large CSV handling (1000+ rows) with chunked parsing to keep the UI responsive.

**PS:** Handled large CSVs efficiently with async parsing + React Suspense to prevent blocking UI threads.

---

### 2. **Query Builder**
Built a fully interactive UI that lets users select **dimensions, metrics, filters, and aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT, etc.)** visually — no raw SQL.  
The state is fully typed and managed via Redux Toolkit slices to keep it predictable and easily extensible.

**PS:** Implemented “instant preview” — query results auto-refresh when parameters change, helping non-technical users see results live.

---

### 3. **Chart Builder**
Integrated **ApexCharts** and **Chart.js** for flexible chart types — Bar, Line, and Pie.  
Charts update automatically when query data changes and preserve configuration state even after navigation.

**PS:** Implemented a reusable `<ChartBuilder />` that unifies data mapping logic and supports dark/light theme out of the box.

---

### 4. **Dashboard Management**
Users can save and organize charts into dashboards, which are fetched and persisted through backend APIs.  
Each dashboard includes **access level** (private, public, shared) and optional sharing to specific users.

**PS:** I optimized the dashboard list and viewer mode to be role-aware — so viewers only see allowed dashboards, but editors/admins retain edit access dynamically.

---

### 5. **Role-Based Access Control**
Roles (Admin, Editor, Viewer) are simulated in frontend state and influence visibility, permissions, and UI availability.  
Protected routes ensure only valid roles access specific screens.

**PS:** Used `PrivateRoute` + centralized `useAuth` hook for role-based navigation; consistent across routes and layout components.

---

### 6. **State Management & Performance**
Used **Redux Toolkit** slices for `auth`, `chart`, `dashboard`, and `query`.  
Each slice isolates async logic via `createAsyncThunk` and uses normalized state.  

**PS:** Designed Redux slices so all CRUD operations are optimistic — UI updates instantly and rolls back if API fails, improving perceived performance.

---

### 7. **UI & Theming**
Built with **Material UI (MUI)** — consistent design system, full dark/light theme switcher, and responsive layouts.  
Dashboard and builder UIs use grid-based adaptive layouts for both desktop and laptop views.

**PS:** Extended MUI theme context for dynamic color palettes used across ApexCharts — ensuring chart color consistency across themes.
